The application manages the current container inventory for the shipment company, introduced in the end to end solution here. We recommend reading the content from the book view. Component view The high level view of the components involved in the solution is illustrated in the figure below: On the left of the figure, the container management microservice (implemented in a separate repository ) supports the Reefer container management and events processing. In the current use case, this component is producing events to a containers topic defined in Kafka / Event Streams. One of those events will be container in maintenance and container out of maintenance. It is also interrested to receive new \"Reefer added\" to the legacy inventory so it can assign order to container. On the right side of the figure, the Inventory app is a JEE application managing the container inventory. We did it in Java because we can partially reuse another code from previous contribution. But the most important thing, it is considered as a legacy app, using MQ as communication layer. It could have been done in other language running on mainframe for example. This app is listening to MQ to get container maintenance messages, and publishes container added message to queues. The MQ source connector is a component that gets messages from the queue, filters messages only about relevant to Reefer container and maps the message as a containerAdded event. This code is based on Event Stream MQ connector. The MQ sink connector is a component to process container events from Kafka container topic, filter only the container on maitenance and off maintenance events and propagate them to MQ for down stream processing. Pre-requisites We assume we have the following pre-installed software: docker MQ running on IBM Cloud, or on IBM Cloud Private, or when running locally using docker. Maven to compile the JEE application. The JEE app is packaged as war file, and deployed on a OpenLiberty server. It could also have been deployed to WebSphere Application Server. Event Stream deployed Sub projects The jee-inventory folder includes the Java based project for managing the container inventory. We make it very simple using maven and deployable on WebSphere or on Liberty.
